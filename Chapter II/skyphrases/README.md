# Task no. 1: Skyphrases

In  skygate,  a  new  system  policy  has  been  put  in  place  that  requires  all  accounts  to  use  a  special 
passphrase  -  skyphrase  -  instead  of simply  a  password.  A  skyphrase  consists  of  a  series  of  words 
(lowercase letters) separated by spaces. To ensure security, a valid skyphrase must contain no duplicate 
words.

For example:
* aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
* aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
* aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
